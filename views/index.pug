Mix in 6 1/2 tablespoons of soft butter, eggs, cardamom, 2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 3 1/2 cups of the flour. Use a wooden spoon to mix the dough. If it's very sticky, mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of flour. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 30 minutes.
                  li Cream together the 2/3 cup butter and 1/2 cup sugar. Stir in the cinnamon.
                  li
                    | Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it until it's firm, about 3 minutes. Divide the dough in half; roll each half into a rectangle no more than 1/2 inch thick. Spread each rectangle with half the filling.

Place the uneven end pieces on the baking sheet cut-side up for the best presentation. Let the rolls rest 20 minutes before baking.

Pull-apart rolls will take longer to bake: after 10 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake the rolls until the sides are fully set, about 10 minutes longer. Cover the baking dish with foil if the rolls begin to get too brown.

                    | Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). In saucepan, combine plums, brown sugar, vinegar, ginger, star anise, clove and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer 30 min., or until thick and syrupy. Discard star anise, clove and cinnamon stick. Set plum chutney aside, keep warm.
                  li
                    | In large bowl, mix butternut squash with 2 tbsp (30 mL) oil, 1 tsp (5 mL) salt and 1/2 tsp (2 mL) pepper to coat. Arrange in single layer on parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast squash 30 to 35 min., turning halfway, until golden brown and tender.
                  li
                    | Meanwhile, season tenderloins with remaining salt and pepper. Heat remaining oil in large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Brown tenderloins on all sides, 4 to 6 min. Place on parchment-lined baking sheet. Cook in the preheated oven 15 to 17 min., or until an instant-read thermometer registers 160°F (71°C) when inserted into the thickest portion of the meat. Let stand 10 min. before slicing.
                  li Served pork with plum chutney and roasted butternut squash on side.
